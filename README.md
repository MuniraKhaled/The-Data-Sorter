# The Data Sorter ðŸ§®
## What?
A humble porgram that sorts big files of data with different sorting algorithms chosen by the user and then mussure the algorithm running time.

### The flow if the program as follows :
1. The data file will be read.
2. Using the Tkinter *the standard GUI library for Python* the window will appear to the user.
3. The user will click the sorting algorthim to be used.
4. The timer will begin. 
5. The sorting and the printing in a new file will happen.
6. The timer will stop once finish and it will show the user the performance.

## Why?
This project was meant for our algorithms class, we were required to implement any of the algorithms we took and to solve problems using them, the reason we chose sorting algorithms is because we wanted to measure how long different sorting algorithms would take in sorting big data (+10k of numbers to sort), and also because estimates suggest that over 25 percent of all computing time is spent on sorting, with some organizations spending more than 50 percent of their computing time sorting lists. This is why it was important to us to understand and to apply most of the sorting algorithms and to know what are thier strengths and weaknesses.
