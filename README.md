# The Data Sorter ðŸ§®
## What?
The porgram will read a big file of numbers provided by the user, and then sort them by one of the sorting algorithm as the user chooses, and then the sorted data in an output file.

### The flow if the program as follows :
1. Using the Tkinter *the standard GUI library for Python* the window will appear to the user.
2. The data file will be read.
3. The user will click the sorting algorthim to be used.
4. The timer will begin. 
5. The sorting and the printing in a new file will happen.
6. The timer will stop once finish and it will show the user the performance.

## Why?
This small project is meant for our data structure class. and the main objectives are :
* Getting the practical knowledge of arrays and several types of linked lists.
* Learning the real-life application of linked lists, arrays and recursion.

## When? 
17/11/2021 until 8/12/2021
